      <itunes:summary>Big things often have small beginnings. Though fairly new and a couple of years into his mobile home parks career, our guest today made good progress on amassing several mobile home parks and is currently growing his affordable home business.

Ryan graduated from the Farmer School of Business at Miami University, Ohio in 2012 with a BS in Finance. During his academic career, Ryan played four years of collegiate baseball on the side. After graduation, he worked in the finance industry prior to getting into the mobile home park industry fulltime. Currently, his portfolio has grown to over five mobile home parks, spreading across 230 lots in the Midwest and Southeast Ohio. Ryan also serves as the director of operations for Buckeye Communities, where he oversees operations on over 500 lots, spreading across 8 parks in Ohio and Michigan. Ryan has been involved with almost every aspect of finding, running, turning around, re-financing, and selling mobile home park communities. 

In this episode, Ryan shares his practices and advice which he gained through a lot of hands-on experience; from acquisitions to property management, and to capital expenditures (capex). He also gives us a detailed overview on how he runs his mobile home park business. For some, it might be a small investment, but Ryan is a big dreamer, and with his focus on his business, who knows? Ryan might be the next biggest owner of mobile home parks in the US.

For him, real estate is a long-term asset that one hangs on to in order to get the best value for the money invested. It’s one of the unique things of Walls Property Management. While most syndications have a fixed holding period, their operating agreements are structured without a definitive endpoint. However, to protect the best interests of the investors, they have crafted exit provisions. In line with this investment strategy, he also discusses why he prefers deep value add deals as opposed to light renovation plans.

Living with modest means as a student, his main focus was to get a job after graduating and he never really thought of going into the real estate industry. It was pure happenstance that he landed in this industry when his company, ExxonMobil transferred him from Houston to Papua New Guinea.

Now retired from the military, Rey has a heart for sharing what he’s learned with veterans and those on active duty so they can set themselves up for the future.  He recognizes that a lot of institutions of higher learning “don’t teach individuals about finances, [...] they teach you how to basically have a job.

      <itunes:summary>Boardwalk’s strategy is to capitalize on favorable demographics and supply/demand in major metro areas in Texas, Florida, and Georgia, through the acquisition of Class B and C multifamily assets.
Our objective is to enhance the value of investments through extensive renovations, while maximizing returns to investors and providing residents with an improved quality of living.

We target assets with highly desirable locations in close proximity to large employment centers, major thoroughfares, public transportation access points, public schools, retail centers and grocery stores.
The end result is affordable, high quality properties, in desirable locations, that are acquired at a discount relative to market.
The value creation achieved by renovating and repositioning these assets allows them to directly compete with newer properties.
